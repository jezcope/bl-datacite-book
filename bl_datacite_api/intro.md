# Introduction

This site provides a number of examples of using Python to automate common tasks for DataCite Members using the DataCite API and a few related services. The examples are presented as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which interleave descriptive text with code and the results of running that code to give a narrative explanation of the workflow which is also directly executable.

You'll see code presented like this, followed by the results of running it:

```{code-cell}
name = "DataCite"
print(f"Hello {name}!")
```

```{tableofcontents}
```
