Rather than saving them in this notebook directly (which would reveal them to _anyone_ with access to the notebook), we instead store them in a separate file called `.env`. `.env` files are a common way of doing this and are supported in Python by the [`python-dotenv`](https://saurabh-kumar.com/python-dotenv/) library. You can specify your own ID and password by creating a file called `.env` in the same folder as this notebook, with contents similar to the following:\n",
